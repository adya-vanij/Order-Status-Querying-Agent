<h1>Order Status Querying Agent</h1>
<h2>Retail/E-commerce Sector</h2>
An intelligent order status management solution that integrates with Unicommerce or other OMS (Order Management System) / CMS (Content Management System) platforms to provide real-time order dispatch details across multiple customer communication channels (WhatsApp, email, phone). The agent automates status checks, handles reshipment requests, and coordinates with internal teams for order fulfillment.
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Manual coordination between support, operations, and logistics teams for handling order statuses, especially for pending shipments and RTO cases, creates operational inefficiencies and increases resolution time.
<h2>Solution Statement</h2>
An automated order status management system that integrates with Unicommerce to provide instant status updates, automate internal team notifications, and streamline reshipment processes.
